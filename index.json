Desirably the narration sould be free of any commitment to any person(s), that is refrain from the use of pronouns such as I, We, Our, Us, etc.\nTo convey understanding, the organization of the lab report should lead to a deft arrangment of information including data, graphs, and pertinent answes to such questions posed by the experiments.\nThe preferred lab report format is typewritten, double-space. thus for this course the guideline for an acceptable lab report format is outlined in the following example  Lab Report Ouline  Lab Report Submission: Student are required to submit an individual lab report for the each experiment. PDFs are the preferred format since PDFs can be uploaded to Blackboard.\n Assignment 1 : Fatigue Failure Assignment 2 : Tension \u0026amp; Compression Test Assignment 3 : Bending of Beam \u0026amp; Moments of Forces Assignment 4 : Internal Forces in Truss Members \u0026amp; End Reaction of a loaded Beam  Make sure you write a separate lab report for each experiment.\n Following are the experiments instructions:\n   Experiment Manual Data Demo     Fatigue Failure Handout   Get Data   Watch   Tension Test Handout   Get Data   Watch   Compression Test Handout   Get Data   Watch   Bending of Beam Handout   Get Data   Watch   Moments of Forces Handout   Get Data   Watch   End Reaction of a Loaded Beam Handout   Get Data   Watch   Interenal Forces in Truss Members Handout   Get Data   Watch    "

Safety measures include halting NC program execution upon impact or axis limit, and warnings of unsafe hardware conditions (e.g., safety shield open, tool missing, tool impact on the cross-slide or holding device).\nAs a powerful visualization tool, the software enables testing and debugging of programming, as well as full machine setup, prior to actual CNC machining and turning.\n Download CNCMotion  "
